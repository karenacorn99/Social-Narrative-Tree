  <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">The following sentence is a prompt to a story that describes a <strong>social</strong> interaction.</p>
  
  <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">${Starter}</p>

  <br>

  <div>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Continue the story in <strong>ONE</strong> sentence. The continuation must contribute to the <strong>relationship</strong> of the people involved.</p>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">If you want to describe the environment(weather, place, etc), link it to what impact it has on their <strong>relationship</strong>.</p>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Be <strong>specific</strong> in your answer. DO NOT write sentences like "they had fun" and "they had a good time": What specific activities they did? What happened during these activities?...</p>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Remember, someone else will continue the story after you, so do NOT end the story yet. It is okay to leave the audience in suspense after rading your sentence.</p>
