  <p style = "margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Sample answer:</strong></p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Given: Amy asked her friend Jenny to go to the mall with her. Amy needed a new dress for the upcoming formal and she wanted to seek advice from Jenny whom she thinks has a good fashion sense.</p>
  <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Good response: At the third shop that they stopped by, Amy tried on a lace dress that she thought really fitted her and asked Jenny for opinions. Jenny casually replied that it did not look good because Amy was too fat.</p>

  <div>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Write <strong>TWO</strong> sentences that describes something happened that had a <strong>significant impact</strong> on the <strong>relationship</strong> between the two people invovled.</p>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Think of it as the <strong>climax</strong> of a narrative.</p>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Be specific, realistic in your answer.</p>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Remember, someone else will continue the story after you, so do NOT end the story yet. It is okay to leave the audience in suspense after rading your sentence.</p>
    <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">Continue the story such that it best reflects social expectations.</p>
